                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>I worked at Yamato Sushi from August of 2019 to October of 2019 as a cashier and it was my first ever job. My primary duties here were to take in-person and phone orders from customers, bag the food once it is finished, preare the condiments, and handle the checkout transactions. Only one cashier is on duty at any given time and the store can become quite busy at dinner times; often there would be anywhere between 7-10 orders simultaneously at any given time, so I was quite overwelmed at the beginning. As my first ever job, it gave me valuable experience in customer service and working under pressure that helped me excel at my next job even if it was short lived.</p>

                <h3>What I have Learned</h3>

                <p>Yamato Sushi is quite a small family-owned store, so the entire staff consisted of 4 people, including myself, at any given time. Although the environment was always friendly, even if it was busy, it was intimidating and nerve wreaking as the only cashier. However, this helped me rapidly develop and prepare myself for future jobs by putting me in constant time pressure and forcing me to pay attention to detail to ensure all customers got exactly what they ordered. I also had to properly communicate with the chefs about any particularities/allergies the customers had so the food could be handled appropriately.</p>

                <p>Every single day was a challenge and a chance to learn something new, so I am always grateful to have had an opportunity to learn so much despite such a short time there. One of the biggest obstacles I had coming into the job was how nervous I was to talk to strangers, but I can safely say that I have become a lot more confident in this regard after this job, and I believe this confidence will continue to help me in the future.</p>
