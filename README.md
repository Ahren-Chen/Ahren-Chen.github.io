# Personal Website

Hello, this is the README doc for the personal website made using Vue. This website was made as an updated version of the previous site made 4 years ago purely using HTML/CSS with the newfounded knowledge of front-end development. Hopefully this will be an ongoing project as I keep updating the profolio with new content but that remains to be seen.
