# Personal Website

Hello, this is the README doc for the personal website made using Vue. This website was made as an updated version of the previous site made 4 years ago purely using HTML/CSS with the newfounded knowledge of front-end development. Hopefully this will be an ongoing project as I keep updating the profolio with new content but that remains to be seen.

## Logbook
- April 27: Finished setting up the basic home page and listed features that are in plan
- April 28: Wanted to finish Feature 2 and get templates up for other pages (About me, experience template, project templates, etc) but only got the template for About Me up and running.
- May 2: Finished feature 6 by adding the resume link to the About Me page. Set up template project links in the Home Page.
- May 12: Worked on setting up the template for projects that will be linked into by the home page. Finished wind turbine project as template, rest of the projects will mainly be copy and paste. Props are unfortunately not applicable since although the layout is similar, the exact number of paragraphs, ordering of images and text etc are not the exact same across projects.
- May 17: Worked on setting up the project pages for the "Get a Grip" project.
- May 26: Finished on "Get a Grip" project page. Finished "Revenge of the Recycling System" project page.
- June 1: Finished "Power in the Community" project page. Set up home page for Skybox and Tub projects.
- June 2: Finished "Skybox" project page and have a template set up for Tub project.
- June 16: Finished Tub project, started to work on adding new projects such as Piraten Karpen, Secure chat application, and Mesh Generator. But for now I will work on tech debt and make everything reuseable since there is too much copy and pasting. Finished refactoring the Get A Grip project.
- July 7: Refactor to use more components.
- July 20: Refactor the About page to use components.
