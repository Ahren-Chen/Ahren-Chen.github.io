                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>I volunteered at 360 Kids Youthrive from January to June 2018 as a student assistant. My role in the programs was to help the staff set up any activities that were planned for the day, interact with children, and promote a fun healthy environment for the children to thrive in. I usually attended after school, and it was an incredible feeling to know that my efforts made other people's days just a little better than before.</p>

                <h3>What I have Learned</h3>

                <p>I volunteered the year before COVID made the program go online, so I got to experience the entire process of planning and spending time with children in person. I got to see how much thought was put into each activity and how the amazing staff was considering each child individually to make sure no one got left out. I helped the staff encourage the children to talk and ensure they felt comfortable at all times while at the program, and it was rewarding to know that they appreciated it.</p>

                <p>This volunteering experience showed me what it means to make a difference in others' lives and how fulfilling that feeling is, which I feel is invaluable going forwards.</p>
