  life. James is diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which affects his ability to perform
  lateral movements and causes him significant strain when forced to reach/apply pressure onto
  his joints. Using our experience up until now, we were given freedom on what design and
  aspect of his life we would target by going through the engineering design process. We
  created our functions, objectives, and constraints and were in charge of prototyping and
  delivering a final product in pitch presentation format. One of the difficulties that James
  faces is his struggle to play board games with his son for extended periods without injury.
  We decided to address this issue and ultimately designed a multifunctional board game
  device: Gamehub. Gamehub allows him to manipulate/move game pieces and roll dice without
  having to reach for them.`,k="/src/assets/Projects_Images/Power_In_Community/gamehub.png",V="Design Process",M=`We first decided on the primary aspect of James's life that we were going to improve and settled
  on board games since they aligned with our interests and everyone's had experiences with a
  variety of board games. I brought up the prompt of whether we should focus on allowing James to
  play a specific family of a board game or focus on generalizing the approach and extending it to
  commonly used board game pieces instead; we decided on the latter. With these critical decisions
  made, we developed a set of objectives and functions for our mechanism. The functions that we
  settled on were: the mechanism must be able to roll dice for the user with minimal involvement,
  accept user input, and be able to hold/transfer game pieces. The objectives that we chose
  included: it must be lightweight, portable, cheap, compact, and comfortable to use. With the
  conclusion of our initial discussions, we each set off to develop sketches/inventor models of
  our ideas.`,S="/src/assets/Projects_Images/Power_In_Community/community_inventor.png",W="/src/assets/Projects_Images/Power_In_Community/community_multiview.png",J="Inventor Model",D="Multiview Sketch of Dice Roller",O=`The aspect I focused on was how to let James roll dice while using minimal movement. My solution
  consisted of a pinball-inspired design where James would drop the dice from the top, and they
  would bounce on the pegs as it gradually descends. Although this design was the initial
  prototype, it fulfilled the objectives set out for the dice roller, and our team created our
  physical prototypes after selecting the best design for each component.`,B="/src/assets/Projects_Images/Power_In_Community/prototype.png",F="Low-Fidelity Prototype",A=`After multiple iterations, we modified our final design to include a card slider to move cards
  between players, a dice roller, and a game piece mover that can be remotely controlled to adjust
  the position of different pieces on the game board and even act as a game piece itself (Figure
  1). We chose to 3D print the dice roller to ensure quality and a custom-made design, and we also
  chose to order a Hexbug online to act as the game piece mover but adjusted the controller to
  better accommodate James's needs. We chose a light, low friction plastic for the card slider to
  reduce the force needed to transfer the cards.`,G="Conclusion",N=`This was my first project that involved a real client and the freedom to decide what we built
  with our objectives/functions. The number of iterations and prototypes that we built for this
  project was incomparable to previous assignments, and we had to resort to outside resources and
  times to complete this project. Several challenges appeared during the testing phase, such as
  ideas that we found were flawed and unpractical and that needed major adjustments. One example
  was that the printing times for the dice roller alone amounted to nearly 19 hours of print time.
  Our solution for this was to print it at the school public library, but when we were notified
  that the print might not come in time, we resorted to creating backups out of wood in case the
  material did not arrive in time. This project was an incredible learning opportunity about the
  unexpected situations that arise when facing real-world problems, and it tested our
  creativity/problem solving to the fullest.`,Y={__name:"Community",setup(E){const c=["Autodesk Inventor","Microsoft Office","Prusa Slicer","Prototyping"],d=["Teamwork","Communication","Time Management","Problem Solving","Creativity"];return(R,q)=>{const s=v("v-slot");return _(),x(p,{class:"fill-height"},{default:t(()=>[e(b,{class:"fill-height text-center"},{default:t(()=>[e(m,{imagePath:I}),e(f,{titleText:j}),e(h,{technical_skills_items:c,soft_skills_items:d}),e(i),e(u,{summaryText:C,summaryImg:k}),e(i),e(a,null,{default:t(()=>[e(s,null,{default:t(()=>[e(n,null,{default:t(()=>[r(l(V))]),_:1}),e(o,{text:M}),e(g,{imageOne:S,imageTwo:W,textOne:J,textTwo:D}),e(o,{text:O}),e(y,{cover:"",width:"500",src:B,class:"mx-auto"}),e(w,{text:F}),e(o,{text:A})]),_:1})]),_:1}),e(a,null,{default:t(()=>[e(s,null,{default:t(()=>[e(n,null,{default:t(()=>[r(l(G))]),_:1}),e(o,{text:N}),P]),_:1})]),_:1})]),_:1})]),_:1})}}};export{Y as default};
