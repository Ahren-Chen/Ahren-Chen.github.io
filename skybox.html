                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Our hackathon team for "To the moon and hack" by major league hacking chose to create a 3D star system simulator. The game works in a sandbox style where you can place down stars/planets and give them qualities such as velocity, mass, gravity constant, and radius. After entering all the desired entities, you can choose which planets/stars can move as well as delete unwanted ones. Once you press the play button, the physics engine will start to simulate the passage of time in this universe and what would happen with these conditions. You can also rotate and move the camera to better observe the simulated environment from different angles.</p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>

                <p>Our team of 4 had 48 hours to create something of our choice using any programming language as long as the theme of "space" was respected. In this regard, we ultimately chose to create a sandbox game using python that heavily relied on physics since it was a shared interest of us all. This was my first hackathon experience, but I had already been comfortable with python for years and was confident enough to create something with my friends.</p>

                <p>For this project, I mainly focused on the front-end to back-end connection between the buttons, images, and textboxes to receive inputs/outputs. Since it was a small group, we were each aware of everyone's roles and positions keenly but worked together when difficulties appeared, so I am also familiar with the structure of all the back-end functions.</p>

                    <p>Automatically Loaded Sample</p>
                </div>

                <p>The most challenging aspect of this hackathon for me was working with others for an extended period. Each member of the group trusted the others to fully complete their portion of the work without error and asked for help if they got stuck. This structure worked amazingly, but the challenging part for me was reading and understanding others' code who had different habits than mine when trying to help them with their unknown error. I overcame this slowly over two days, and I learned what it means to work in a small group and gained valuable experience working/learning under a tight time constraints.</p>
