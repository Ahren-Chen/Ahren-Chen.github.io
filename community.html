                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Our client James allowed us to create a design that would improve an aspect of his daily life. James is diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, which affects his ability to perform lateral movements and causes him significant strain when forced to reach/apply pressure onto his joints. Using our experience up until now, we were given freedom on what design and aspect of his life we would target by going through the engineering design process. We created our functions, objectives, and constraints and were in charge of prototyping and delivering a final product in pitch presentation format. One of the difficulties that James faces is his struggle to play board games with his son for extended periods without injury. We decided to address this issue and ultimately designed a multifunctional board game device: Gamehub. Gamehub allows him to manipulate/move game pieces and roll dice without having to reach for them.</p>

                <h3>Design Process</h3>

                <p>We first decided on the primary aspect of James's life that we were going to improve and settled on board games since they aligned with our interests and everyone's had experiences with a variety of board games. I brought up the prompt of whether we should focus on allowing James to play a specific family of a board game or focus on generalizing the approach and extending it to commonly used board game pieces instead; we decided on the latter. With these critical decisions made, we developed a set of objectives and functions for our mechanism. The functions that we settled on were: the mechanism must be able to roll dice for the user with minimal involvement, accept user input, and be able to hold/transfer game pieces. The objectives that we chose included: it must be lightweight, portable, cheap, compact, and comfortable to use. With the conclusion of our initial discussions, we each set off to develop sketches/inventor models of our ideas.</p>

                <p>The aspect I focused on was how to let James roll dice while using minimal movement. My solution consisted of a pinball-inspired design where James would drop the dice from the top, and they would bounce on the pegs as it gradually descends. Although this design was the initial prototype, it fulfilled the objectives set out for the dice roller, and our team created our physical prototypes after selecting the best design for each component.</p>

                </div>

                <p>After multiple iterations, we modified our final design to include a card slider to move cards between players, a dice roller, and a game piece mover that can be remotely controlled to adjust the position of different pieces on the game board and even act as a game piece itself (Figure 1). We chose to 3D print the dice roller to ensure quality and a custom-made design, and we also chose to order a Hexbug online to act as the game piece mover but adjusted the controller to better accommodate James's needs. We chose a light, low friction plastic for the card slider to reduce the force needed to transfer the cards.</p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    
                <p>This was my first project that involved a real client and the freedom to decide what we built with our objectives/functions. The number of iterations and prototypes that we built for this project was incomparable to previous assignments, and we had to resort to outside resources and times to complete this project. Several challenges appeared during the testing phase, such as ideas that we found were flawed and unpractical and that needed major adjustments. One example was that the printing times for the dice roller alone amounted to nearly 19 hours of print time. Our solution for this was to print it at the school public library, but when we were notified that the print might not come in time, we resorted to creating backups out of wood in case the material did not arrive in time. This project was an incredible learning opportunity about the unexpected situations that arise when facing real-world problems, and it tested our creativity/problem solving to the fullest.</p>
