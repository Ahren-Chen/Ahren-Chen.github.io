                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>I worked at Walmart from October 2020 to August 2021 as a front-end associate. My primary duties consisted of being a cashier and overseeing self-checkout while following COVID guidelines and advertising the Walmart credit card. I am extremely grateful for this job as it allowed me to experience retail from a company perspective and develop my interpersonal skill set. Occasionally the job required me to assist other departments (fashion, produce, outdoor, etc.), so I was able to experience multiple aspects of the process necessary to deliver a shopping experience to customers.</p>

                <h3>What I have Learned</h3>

                <p>During my time at Walmart, I was able to efficiently develop skills related to customer service, working under pressure, and attention to detail. As a cashier, it is expected that you can handle a variety of situations and multitask for hours at a time to ensure maximum customer satisfaction. An example would be scanning, bagging, conversing with the customer, handling payments, and advertising the rewards program while the number of items scanned per hour is recorded on the register to be reviewed later. I managed to quickly adapt to this fast-paced environment but had trouble conversing with customers at the beginning. As I slowly got more comfortable, the conversations became more natural, and my ability to calmly handle difficult situations increased. I developed self-control and empathy during my time here by resolving issues with frustrated customers and my persuasive speaking skills by selling the Walmart rewards program. </p>

                <p>I experienced the greatest amount of difficulty during the Christmas season due to a high inflow of customers and work efficiency audits. During this time, it wasn't uncommon to service customers for several hours without rest which is how I learned to work consistently for long periods of time. The supervisors would also regularly come to check if I was following guidelines which trained my ability to work well under pressure.</p>
